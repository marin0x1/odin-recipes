            <li>4 tsp tamari sauce or soy sauce</li>

            <li>2 tsp maple syrup or coconut syrup</li>
            <li>2 tsp oil</li>
            <li>1 tsp smoked paprika</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>            
        <ol>
            <li>Place cashews in a bowl and let them soak overnight.
                (Alternatively, you can boil them for 15 minutes).
                Then drain and rinse the Cashews. Add them in the blender along with the water, vegetable broth, and yeast flakes.
                Blend until smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>Cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions.
                Then drain, toss with a little olive oil (to avoid sticking) and put back into the pot.</li> 
            <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a pan over medium heat and saut√© the mushrooms
                (if using) until soft and browned, about 7-8 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for a further minute.</li>
            <li>Add the cashew cream along with the pasta and peas to the Carbonara sauce.
                Toss to combine. If the sauce gets too thick, add a bit more water or non-dairy milk (for more creaminess),
                or simply cook it longer, if it is too thin. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
                Serve hot with coconut bacon and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
